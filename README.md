Introduction
Durring this challenge, I ran into major problems with corrupt cvs/excel files so that every additional time I donloaded new version those files became corrupt. I had to go to another computer and download a file then bring it in from a thumbdrive. Consequently, I only have one month of data that I'm working with. In addition, I did not include my juputer notebook where I combined files a plenty with the ambitious hopes of doing some great stuff. I ended up rushing to the very last minute and I hope that what I have done is enough.

Analysis
1. Maps of stations and popularity
We see that map of staions with relative size of circle indicating the number of bikes where trips were initiated. The bunches of stations with the highest count of trips started are in the North and South of the area with a few the largest circles in the middle. The eastern part appears to have much less usership.
2. Peak traffic times
The peak traffic times for the month of August in 2013 was 5PM and 6PM, which makes sense for people using the service to return home after work. 7AM and 8AM were the second tier of peak times. 12PM and 1PM make up the third tier of peak times.
3. Gender Breakdown
Durring this month Males were 3 times as more likely than females to use the service.
4. Trip Duration
As the count of bikes in use increases so does the trip duration in general.
